## The Challenge Steps

### Planning 

### HTML
Your resume needs to be written in HTML and styled with CSS. Not a Word doc or a PDF. Here is an example of what I mean.

### Static Website
Deploy your HTML resume online as an Azure Storage static website. Although services like Netlify and GitHub Pages are great, we’ll use Azure Storage for this project.

### HTTPS
Ensure the Azure Storage website URL uses HTTPS for security. Use Azure CDN to help with this.

### DNS
Point a custom DNS domain name to the Azure CDN endpoint so your resume can be accessed at something like my-c00l-resume-website.com. Use Azure DNS or any other DNS provider.

### JavaScript
Your resume webpage should include a visitor counter that displays how many people have accessed the site. Write a bit of JavaScript to make this happen.

### Database
The visitor counter will need to retrieve and update its count in a database. Use the Table API of Azure’s CosmosDB for this.

### API
Create an API that accepts requests from your web app and communicates with the database. Use Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger for this.

### Python
Write some code in the Azure Function using Python, a common language used in back-end programs and scripts.

### Test
Include some tests for your Python code. Here are some resources on writing good Python tests.

### Infrastructure as Code
Do not configure your API resources manually. Define them in an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template on a Consumption plan. This is called “infrastructure as code” or IaC.

### Source Control
Set up a GitHub repository for your backend code. Create another repository for your website code.

### CI/CD (Back End)
Set up GitHub Actions to run your Python tests and deploy your ARM application to Azure when you push updates.

### CI/CD (Front End)
Create GitHub Actions to update the Azure Storage blob with your website code whenever you push updates.

### Blog Post
In the text of your resume, link a short blog post describing some things you learned while working on this project. Dev.to or Hashnode are great places to publish if you don’t have your own blog.

### Conclusion
Join me on my Cloud Resume Challenge journey as I transition from cloud education to a cloud career. This challenge will enhance my resume with practical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and CI/CD, among others.
